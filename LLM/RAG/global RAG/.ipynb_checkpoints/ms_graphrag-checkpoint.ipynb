    "# GraphRAG with Neo4j and LangChain: Constructing the Graph\n",
    "## Combine text extraction, network analysis, and LLM prompting and summarization for improved RAG accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "I am always intrigued by new approaches to implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over graphs, often called GraphRAG. However, it seems that everyone has a different implementation in mind when they hear the term GraphRAG. In this blog post, we will dive deep into the “From Local to Global GraphRAG” article and implementation by Microsoft researchers. We will cover the knowledge graph construction and summarization part and leave the retrievers for the next blog post. The researchers were so kind as to provide us with the code repository, and they have a [project page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken in the article mentioned above is quite interesting. As far as I understand, it involves using a knowledge graph as a step in the pipeline for condensing and combining information from multiple sources. Extracting entities and relationships from text is nothing new. However, the authors introduce a novel (at least to me) idea of summarizing condensed graph structure and information back as natural language text. The pipeline begins with input text from documents, which are processed to generate a graph. The graph is then converted back into natural language text, where the generated text contains condensed information about specific entities or graph communities previously spread across multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*NWkjGfKvWyKJsXfj-HxVjA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very high level, the input to the GraphRAG pipeline are source documents containing various information. The documents are processed using an LLM to extract structured information about entities appearing in the papers along with their relationships. This extracted structured information is then used to construct a knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using a knowledge graph data representation is that it can quickly and straightforwardly combine information from multiple documents or data sources about particular entities. As mentioned, the knowledge graph is not the only data representation, though. After the knowledge graph has been constructed, they use a combination of graph algorithms and LLM prompting to generate natural language summaries of communities of entities found in the knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "These summaries then contain condensed information spreading across multiple data sources and documents for particular entities and communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed understanding of the pipeline, we can refer to the step-by-step description provided in the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:942/format:webp/1*xn10XHns9xQ1WLQxEaSA7w.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is a high-level summary of the pipeline that we will use to reproduce their approach using Neo4j and LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Indexing — Graph Generation\n",
    "Source Documents to Text Chunks: Source documents are split into smaller text chunks for processing.\n",
    "* Text Chunks to Element Instances: Each text chunk is analyzed to extract entities and relationships, producing a list of tuples representing these elements.\n",
    "* Element Instances to Element Summaries: Extracted entities and relationships are summarized by the LLM into descriptive text blocks for each element.\n",
    "* Element Summaries to Graph Communities: These entity summaries form a graph, which is then partitioned into communities using algorithms like Leiden for hierarchical structure.\n",
    "* Graph Communities to Community Summaries: Summaries of each community are generated with the LLM to understand the dataset’s global topical structure and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retrieval — Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Community Summaries to Global Answers: Community summaries are used to answer a user query by generating intermediate answers, which are then aggregated into a final global answer.\n",
    "Note that my implementation was done before their code was available, so there might be slight differences in the underlying approach or LLM prompts being used. I’ll try to explain those differences as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up the Neo4j Environment\n",
    "We will use Neo4j as the underlying graph store. The easiest way to get started is to use a free instance of Neo4j Sandbox, which offers cloud instances of the Neo4j database with the Graph Data Science plugin installed. Alternatively, you can set up a local instance of the Neo4j database by downloading the Neo4j Desktop application and creating a local database instance. If you are using a local version, make sure to install both APOC and GDS plugins. For production setups, you can use the paid, managed AuraDS (Data Science) instance, which provides the GDS plugin.\n",

    "We start by creating a Neo4jGraph instance, which is the convenience wrapper we added to LangChain:"

    "The text chunking step is crucial and significantly impacts downstream results. The paper authors found that using smaller text chunks results in extracting more entities overall.\n",

    "![title](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1120/format:webp/1*9HdF1xQ6Tm6dazOQBFvSvg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, using text chunks of 2,400 tokens results in fewer extracted entities than when they used 600 tokens. Additionally, they identified that LLMs might not extract all entities on the first run. In that case, they introduce a heuristics to perform the extraction multiple times. We will talk about that more in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are always trade-offs. Using smaller text chunks can result in losing the context and coreferences of specific entities spread across the documents. For example, if a document mentions “John” and “he” in separate sentences, breaking the text into smaller chunks might make it unclear that “he” refers to John. Some of the coreference issues can be solved using an overlap text chunking strategy, but not all of them.\n",

    "The distribution of article token counts is approximately normal, with a peak of around 400 tokens. The frequency of chunks gradually increases up to this peak, then decreases symmetrically, indicating most text chunks are near the 400-token mark.\n",

    "### Extracting Nodes and Relationships\n",
    "The next step is constructing knowledge from text chunks. For this use case, we use an LLM to extract structured information in the form of nodes and relationships from the text. You can examine the LLM prompt the authors used in the paper. They have LLM prompts where we can predefine node labels if needed, but by default, that’s optional. Additionally, the extracted relationships in the original documentation don’t really have a type, only a description. I imagine the reason behind this choice is to allow the LLM to extract and retain richer and more nuanced information as relationships. But it’s difficult to have a clean knowledge graph with no relationship-type specifications (the descriptions could go into a property).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation, we will use the LLMGraphTransformer, which is available in the LangChain library. Instead of using pure prompt engineering, as the implementation in the article paper does, the LLMGraphTransformer uses the built-in function calling support to extract structured information (structured output LLMs in LangChain). You can inspect the system prompt:"

    "The scatter plot shows that while there is a positive trend, indicated by the red line, the relationship is sublinear. Most data points cluster at lower entity counts, even as token counts increase. This indicates that the number of entities extracted does not scale proportionally with the size of the text chunks. Although some outliers exist, the general pattern shows that higher token counts do not consistently lead to higher entity counts. This validates the authors’ finding that lower text chunk sizes will extract more information.\n",

    "### Entity Resolution\n",
    "Entity resolution (de-duplication) is crucial when constructing knowledge graphs because it ensures that each entity is uniquely and accurately represented, preventing duplicates and merging records that refer to the same real-world entity. This process is essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the graph. Without entity resolution, knowledge graphs would suffer from fragmented and inconsistent data, leading to errors and unreliable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*rlWiW1sWlixDTaY0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This image demonstrates how a single real-world entity might appear under slightly different names in different documents and, consequently, in our graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, sparse data becomes a significant issue without entity resolution. Incomplete or partial data from various sources can result in scattered and disconnected pieces of information, making it difficult to form a coherent and comprehensive understanding of entities. Accurate entity resolution addresses this by consolidating data, filling in gaps, and creating a unified view of each entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, entity resolution enhances the efficiency of data retrieval and integration, providing a cohesive view of information across different sources. It ultimately enables more effective question-answering based on a reliable and complete knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the authors of the GraphRAG paper did not include any entity resolution code in their repo, although they mention it in their paper. One reason for leaving this code out could be that it is tough to implement a robust and well-performing entity resolution for any given domain. You can implement custom heuristics for different nodes when dealing with pre-defined types of nodes (when they aren’t predefined, they aren’t consistent enough, like company, organization, business, etc.). However, if the node labels or types aren’t known in advance, as in our case, this becomes an even harder problem. Nonetheless, we will implement a version of entity resolution in our project here, combining text embeddings and graph algorithms with word distance and LLMs.\n",

    "Our process for entity resolution involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Entities in the graph — Start with all entities within the graph.\n",
    "2. K-nearest graph — Construct a k-nearest neighbor graph, connecting similar entities based on text embeddings.\n",
    "3. Weakly Connected Components — Identify weakly connected components in the k-nearest graph, grouping entities that are likely to be similar. Add a word distance filtering step after these components have been identified.\n",
    "4. LLM evaluation — Use an LLM to evaluate these components and decide whether the entities within each component should be merged, resulting in a final decision on entity resolution (for example, merging ‘Silicon Valley Bank’ and ‘Silicon_Valley_Bank’ while rejecting the merge for different dates like ‘September 16, 2023’ and ‘September 2, 2023’).\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by calculating text embeddings for the name and description properties of entities. We can use the from_existing_graph method in the Neo4jVector integration in LangChain to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use these embeddings to find potential candidates that are similar based on the cosine distance of these embeddings. We will use graph algorithms available in the Graph Data Science (GDS) library; therefore, we can use the GDS Python client for ease of use in a Pythonic way:\n",
    "\n",
    "我们首先计算实体的名称和描述属性的文本嵌入。我们可以在LangChain的Neo4jVector集成中使用from现有的图方法来实现这一点：\n",
    "\n",
    "我们可以使用这些embeddings来找到基于这些embeddings的余弦距离的潜在的相似候选。我们将使用图数据科学（GDS）库中提供的图算法；因此，我们可以使用GDS Python客户端以Python的方式方便使用："

    "### Element Summarization\n",
    "In the next step, the authors perform an element summarization step. Essentially, every node and relationship gets passed through an entity summarization prompt. The authors note the novelty and interest of their approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Overall, our use of rich descriptive text for homogeneous nodes in a potentially noisy graph structure is aligned with both the capabilities of LLMs and the needs of global, query-focused summarization. These qualities also differentiate our graph index from typical knowledge graphs, which rely on concise and consistent knowledge triples (subject, predicate, object) for downstream reasoning tasks.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is exciting. We still extract subject and object IDs or names from text, which allows us to link relationships to correct entities, even when entities appear across multiple text chunks. However, the relationships aren’t reduced to a single type. Instead, the relationship type is actually a freeform text that allows us to retain richer and more nuanced information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the entity information is summarized using an LLM, allowing us to embed and index this information and entities more efficiently for more accurate retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue that this richer and more nuanced information could also be retained by adding additional, possibly arbitrary, node and relationship properties. One issue with arbitrary node and relationship properties is that it could be hard to extract the information consistently because the LLM might use different property names or focus on various details on every execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these problems could be solved using predefined property names with additional type and description information. In that case, you would need a subject-matter expert to help define those properties, leaving little room for an LLM to extract any vital information outside the predefined descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s an exciting approach to represent richer information in a knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential issue with the element summarization step is that it does not scale well since it requires an LLM call for every entity and relationship in the graph. Our graph is relatively tiny with 13,000 nodes and 16,000 relationships. Even for such a small graph, we would require 29,000 LLM calls, and each call would use a couple hundred tokens, making it quite expensive and time-intensive. Therefore, we will avoid this step here.
